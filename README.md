# React Inbox

## Description
Gmail clone, built in React, that stores data in-memory using an [API](https://github.com/JBallin/g-api) provided by Galvanize (with some modifications). I was given the basic HTML structure and seed data but otherwise built everything on my own.

This was built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and can be run using:

```
Note: [API](https://github.com/JBallin/g-api) must be running as well.
